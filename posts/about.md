# making things on the web

I'm a **frontend developer** for about 10 years, based in *Rennes, France*, particularly concerned with **quality** and **simplicity**.

## making webapps

Currently @ [Yousign](https://yousign.com) on the saas product team, i'm working on a new javascript web application to make *eSignature experience so easy*. I use libraries like **React**, **Styled Components**, **react-query**, **Downshift** etc.

We are a team with high demands on quality and scalability, so we are doing lot of code review with each other, we are constantly challenging our codebase and we are testing a lot (we are using that way **react-testing-library** to produce our unit or functional tests, **Cypress** for our end-to-end tests).

We are also trying, with designers team, to maintain our Design System as a centerpiece. A **Storybook** that you can [consult here](https://storybook.yousign.app) by the way. ðŸ™‚

## making websites & eshops

I'm also used to take projects or side-projects as a freelancer. From this point of view, I most often take part in smaller projects such as websites or online shops by trying to propose the most flexible solutions. 
[<abbr title="Javascript APIs Markup">JAMStack</abbr>](https://jamstack.wtf/) & <abbr title="Static Site Generation">SSG</abbr> are the things i usually practice with framework as **GatsbyJS** or **NextJS** and some new kind of <abbr title='Content Managing System'>CMS</abbr> [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/), [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) or [TinaCMS](https://tinacms.org/).

Take a ride to my last eshop reference (which i made with GatsbyJS / Sanity & Snipcart) : [Demisel Bijoux](http://demiselbijoux.com/)
